## üìå Summary of Algorithms

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Linear Search**
- **Description:** A basic way to find an element in any list by checking each element one by one.
- **Strengths:** Easy to implement, works on unsorted data.
- **Weaknesses:** Slow for large datasets due to O(n) time complexity.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Binary Search**
- **Description:** A faster search method for sorted lists, cutting the search space in half at each step.
- **Strengths:** Very efficient for large sorted lists with O(log n) time complexity.
- **Weaknesses:** Requires the list to be sorted beforehand.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Bubble Sort**
- **Description:** A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- **Strengths:** Easy to understand and implement, good for teaching purposes.
- **Weaknesses:** Inefficient for large datasets due to O(n¬≤) time complexity.

## üìå Conclusion
- **Linear Search** is best for small or unsorted lists where simplicity is more important than speed.
- **Binary Search** is ideal for large, sorted lists where efficiency is key.
- **Bubble Sort** is primarily used for learning purposes and is not suitable for practical use on large datasets.
