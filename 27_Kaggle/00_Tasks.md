# üöÄ Day 27: Engage in a Kaggle Competition

## üéØ Goal
Apply your full ML workflow‚Äîfrom data loading and exploration to model building, evaluation, and deployment‚Äîby participating in a real Kaggle competition. You‚Äôll gain hands-on experience with end-to-end data science practices and learn how to work with public ML challenges.

---

## üîß Tools & Environment
- **Kaggle Notebooks** (or local Jupyter/Colab)
- **Kaggle API** (for data download & submission)
- **Python Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `xgboost` or `lightgbm` (optional)

---

## üõ† Step-by-Step Tasks

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Select a Beginner Competition
- Recommended:
  - **Titanic ‚Äì Machine Learning from Disaster**
  - **House Prices ‚Äì Advanced Regression Techniques**
- Navigate to the competition page and **Join Competition**.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Your Environment
#### Option A: Kaggle Notebook
- No setup required. Use Kaggle's built-in environment.

#### Option B: Local Setup
1. Install Kaggle CLI:
   - `# pip install kaggle`
2. Place your `kaggle.json` API token in `~/.kaggle/`.
3. Download data:
   - `# kaggle competitions download -c titanic`
   - `# unzip titanic.zip -d data/`

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Exploration & Visualization
1. Load the `train.csv` and `test.csv` with Pandas.
2. Display:
   - Head of the dataset.
   - Summary statistics.
   - Missing-value counts.
3. Create visualizations:
   - **Titanic**: Survival rates by gender and passenger class.
   - **House Prices**: Price distributions and correlations.
4. Document key insights in markdown cells or comments.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
1. Handle missing values (e.g., fill with median or mode).
2. Encode categorical variables (one-hot encoding or label encoding).
3. Create new features if relevant (e.g., family size on Titanic).
4. Split your training data into train/validation sets (e.g., 80/20 split).

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Build Baseline Models
1. **Titanic**: Logistic Regression or Random Forest Classifier.
2. **House Prices**: Linear Regression or Decision Tree Regressor.
3. Train on the training set and evaluate on validation using appropriate metrics:
   - **Accuracy / ROC-AUC** for classification.
   - **MAE / RMSE** for regression.
4. Record baseline performance.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Improve Your Model
1. Try ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM).
2. Tune hyperparameters with `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV`.
3. Add cross-validation to get more robust score estimates.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Generate a Submission
1. Predict on the `test.csv` data.
2. Create a `submission.csv` file with the required format:
   ```plaintext
   PassengerId,Survived
   892,0
   893,1
   ...
...  
Submit via Kaggle API or notebook interface:

bash
Copy
Edit
kaggle competitions submit -c titanic -f submission.csv -m "First submission"
### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Analyze Your Leaderboard Position
1. Check your public leaderboard score.
2. Review the kernels (notebooks) of top performers to learn advanced techniques.

---

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Document Your Work
Write a brief report summarizing:
- **Data insights**.
- **Feature engineering choices**.
- **Model performance before and after tuning**.
- **Thoughts on next improvements**.
