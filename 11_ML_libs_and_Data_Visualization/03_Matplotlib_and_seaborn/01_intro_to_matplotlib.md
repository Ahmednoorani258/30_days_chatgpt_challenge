# ðŸ“Š Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn

Visualizations transform raw data into meaningful insights, making it easier to understand patterns, trends, and anomalies. In Python, **Matplotlib** provides the foundation for creating basic plots, while **Seaborn** enhances this capability with stylish, statistically oriented visualizations.

This guide will walk you through the fundamentals of data visualization, focusing on three key plot typesâ€”**histograms**, **scatter plots**, and **boxplots**â€”using practical examples and a hands-on exercise. By the end, youâ€™ll have a solid grasp of how to explore and present data effectively.

## ðŸŒŸ Why Visualize Data?

Data visualization is essential for several reasons:

1. **Patterns**:
   - Visuals help you spot trends that might be hidden in raw numbers.
   - Example: You can quickly see if larger houses tend to have higher prices.

2. **Outliers**:
   - Anomalies, such as an unusually expensive house, stand out more clearly in a plot than in a spreadsheet.

3. **Communication**:
   - Plots make complex data accessible and understandable to others.

By turning numbers into visuals, you gain a deeper understanding of your dataset and can share insights more effectively.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts

Before diving into the code, letâ€™s cover the basics:

### 1. **Plot Types**:
- **Histogram**:
  - Displays the distribution of a single variable (e.g., how house prices are spread across a range).
- **Scatter Plot**:
  - Shows the relationship between two variables (e.g., house size vs. price).
- **Boxplot**:
  - Summarizes data across categories, highlighting medians, quartiles, and outliers (e.g., price distribution by the number of bedrooms).

### 2. **Customization**:
- Adding labels, titles, and colors ensures your plots are clear and visually appealing.

## ðŸ›  Example Dataset: `house_prices.csv`

Weâ€™ll use a sample dataset, `house_prices.csv`, with the following columns:
- **Price**: The price of the house.
- **Size**: The size of the house in square feet.
- **Bedrooms**: The number of bedrooms in the house.

## ðŸŽ¯ Hands-On Exercise

Later in this guide, youâ€™ll apply these concepts to the **Titanic dataset**, exploring survival rates and other variables using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
