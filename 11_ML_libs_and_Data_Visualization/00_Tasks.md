## üìå Objectives for Day 11

### 1. Master Data Manipulation with NumPy and Pandas:
- Understand how to work with arrays using **NumPy**.
- Load, clean, and manipulate datasets using **Pandas**.

### 2. Visualize Data Effectively:
- Create various plots using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
- Learn how to interpret visualizations to extract insights.

### 3. Integrate ML Data Workflows:
- Prepare datasets for ML models by cleaning and transforming data.
- Practice **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand dataset distributions and relationships.

---

## üõ† Detailed Tasks & Exercises

### 1. Explore NumPy Fundamentals
#### Key Concepts:
- Create and manipulate **NumPy arrays**.
- Understand array operations (vectorized operations, slicing, indexing).

#### Exercise:
- Create a NumPy array of random numbers.
- Perform basic operations such as `sum`, `mean`, and `standard deviation`.
- Use slicing to extract subarrays.

---

### 2. Data Handling with Pandas
#### Key Concepts:
- Load CSV or Excel files into a **DataFrame**.
- Perform data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates).
- Filter and sort data.

#### Exercise:
- Import a sample dataset (e.g., a CSV file of house prices, Titanic dataset, or any public dataset).
- Clean the dataset: remove missing values, correct data types.
- Compute summary statistics (mean, median, etc.) for key columns.
- Use `groupby` to aggregate data by a categorical variable.

---

### 3. Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn
#### Key Concepts:
- Create basic plots (line, scatter, bar, histogram) using **Matplotlib**.
- Enhance plots with **Seaborn** for statistical visualizations.

#### Exercise:
- Plot a histogram to show the distribution of a numerical column (e.g., house prices).
- Create a scatter plot to analyze the relationship between two variables (e.g., house size vs. price).
- Use Seaborn‚Äôs `boxplot` or `violin plot` to compare distributions across categories.

### 4. Integrate Your Workflow into an ML Pipeline
#### Task:
Prepare a mini-project where you:
1. Load a dataset with **Pandas**.
2. Clean and explore the data.
3. Visualize key features and relationships.
4. Document your findings and insights in the form of comments or markdown cells (if using a Jupyter Notebook).

---

### 5. Bonus Challenge (Optional): Interactive Dashboard
#### Task:
- Use **Streamlit** or **Plotly Dash** to build a simple interactive dashboard that displays your visualizations.
- Allow users to select different features to plot or filter the dataset.

## üéØ Learning Outcomes

By the end of Day 11, you should be able to:
1. Confidently manipulate arrays and datasets with **NumPy** and **Pandas**.
2. Create clear, insightful visualizations with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
3. Understand how to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, a critical step before model building.
4. Integrate these tools into your overall ML workflow for data preparation and analysis.
