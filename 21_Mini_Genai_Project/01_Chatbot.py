# 🧩 Let’s Build It Step by Step
# ✅ Step 1: How Does a Chatbot Work?
# Imagine you’re talking to your best friend:

# You say: “I’m super happy today!”
# Your friend listens, thinks “Oh, they’re happy!” and says: “Cool, me too!”
# A chatbot works the same way, but it’s a computer. Here’s how it happens:

# You talk to it: You type something like “Hi!” or “What’s up?”
# It figures out what you mean: This is called intent recognition. It’s like the chatbot guessing if you’re saying hello, asking a question, or sharing a feeling.
# It picks a reply: Based on what it guessed, it says something back, like “Hey there!” or “I’ll help you out!”
# So, the chatbot has two big jobs:

# Guessing what you mean (the “intent”).
# Saying something nice or helpful back.
# Example:

# You type: “I’m bored.”
# Chatbot thinks: “They’re feeling bored.”
# Chatbot says: “Let’s play a game!”


# ✅ Step 2: Guessing What You Mean with Transformers
# How does the chatbot guess what you’re feeling or asking? We use a transformer model—it’s like a robot librarian who’s read every book and knows all about words.

# We’ll borrow a pre-trained transformer from Hugging Face (a website with free smart tools). Let’s try one that guesses emotions, like if you’re happy or sad.

# Tell Python to grab the transformer tool
from transformers import pipeline

# Load a super-smart emotion-guesser
classifier = pipeline("text-classification", model="bhadresh-savani/bert-base-uncased-emotion")

# Test it with something you might say
result = classifier("I'm feeling really happy today!")
print(result)


# What’s happening here?

# pipeline: This is like a magic wand that makes the transformer easy to use.
# classifier: Our emotion-guesser—it’s ready to look at your words.
# "I'm feeling really happy today!": You give it a sentence.
# print(result): It tells you what it thinks!

#### Output ####
# [{'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.96}]

# label: 'joy': It guesses you’re happy!
# score: 0.96: It’s 96% sure (out of 100%). Pretty confident, right?
# For our chatbot, we can use this to guess stuff like:

# “Hi” → Intent: Greeting
# “Help me!” → Intent: Help
# “Bye” → Intent: Goodbye



#### Step 3 #####

# ✅ Step 3: Picking a Reply
# Once the chatbot knows what you mean (like “joy” or “greeting”), it needs to say something back. Let’s make a list of replies it can pick from, like a cheat sheet.


# A function is like a little recipe the computer follows
def get_response(intent):
    # Our cheat sheet of replies
    responses = {
    "joy": "That’s awesome! 😄",
    "sadness": "I’m here for you. 💙",
    "greeting": "Hi there! How can I help?",
    "goodbye": "See ya later! 👋",
    "anger": "Let’s chill out together. 🧘",
    "fear": "It’s okay, take a deep breath. You’re not alone. 🌟",
    "surprise": "Wow, that’s unexpected! 🤯",
    "help": "Sure, let me know how I can assist you. 🛠️",
    "confusion": "I’ll do my best to clarify things for you. 🤔",
    "gratitude": "You’re welcome! I’m happy to help. 😊",
    "curiosity": "That’s an interesting question! Let me think... 🤓",
    "boredom": "Let’s find something fun to do! 🎮",
    "love": "Aww, that’s so sweet! ❤️",
    "neutral": "Got it. Let me know if there’s anything else. 🙂",
    "weather": "I can’t check the weather right now, but it’s always a good day to learn something new! 🌤️",
    "joke": "Why don’t scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything! 😂",
    "unknown": "I’m not sure how to respond to that, but I’m here to help! 🤖"
}
    # Pick the reply that matches the intent, or say something else if it’s confused
    return responses.get(intent.lower(), "Hmm, I don’t know what to say!")

# Chat with the bot
you_say = input("What do you want to say? ")
result = classifier(you_say)[0]  # Guess the emotion
emotion = result["label"]  # Get the emotion (like "joy")
reply = get_response(emotion)  # Pick a reply
print("Bot says:", reply)
# What’s happening?

# def get_response(intent): This is our reply-picker. You give it an intent (like “joy”), and it finds a reply.
# responses: Our list of intents and replies—like a dictionary!
# .get(intent.lower(), ...): It looks for the intent in the list (and makes it lowercase so “JOY” and “joy” both work). If it’s not there, it says something generic.
# Why this is cool: You can add as many intents and replies as you want
