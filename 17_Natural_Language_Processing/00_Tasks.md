### ✅ 2. Install Latest Tools
Install the required libraries for NLP tasks:

```bash
pip install spacy transformers datasets torch
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```
✅ 3. Start with spaCy
spaCy is a powerful NLP library optimized for production use.

👉 Practice Tasks:

Tokenization

Part-of-speech tagging

Lemmatization

Named Entity Recognition

📘 spaCy Documentation

✅ 4. Use Hugging Face Transformers
Hugging Face provides pre-trained transformer models for text classification, summarization, translation, and more.

👉 Start with:



<!-- from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
result = classifier("Python and AI are the future!")
print(result) -->

# ✅ Explore Hugging Face Pipelines

Hugging Face provides pre-trained transformer models for various NLP tasks. Here are some additional pipelines to explore:

### Other Pipelines to Try:
1. **Text Classification**: Classify text into categories.
2. **Summarization**: Generate concise summaries from long text.
3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identify entities like names, dates, and locations in text.
