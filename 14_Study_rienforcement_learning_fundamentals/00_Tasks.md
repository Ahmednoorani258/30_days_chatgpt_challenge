# ðŸš€ Day 14: Study Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Understand the fundamentals of **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and explore how agents learn by interacting with environments. This will help you prepare for advanced AI topics, including AI agents and decision-making systems.

## ðŸ“š Topics to Cover

1. **What is Reinforcement Learning?**
   - How RL differs from supervised and unsupervised learning.

2. **Key Terms**:
   - **Agent**: The learner or decision-maker.
   - **Environment**: The world the agent interacts with.
   - **Actions**: Choices the agent can make.
   - **Rewards**: Feedback the agent receives for its actions.
   - **Policy**: The strategy the agent uses to decide actions.

3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - Balancing trying new actions (exploration) vs. sticking to known good actions (exploitation).

4. **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**:
   - Understanding:
     - **States**: The current situation of the agent.
     - **Actions**: Possible moves the agent can make.
     - **Rewards**: Feedback for actions.
     - **Transition Probabilities**: Likelihood of moving between states.
   - How MDP helps model decision-making problems.

5. **Types of Reinforcement Learning**:
   - **Model-Free RL**:
     - Examples: Q-Learning, Policy Gradient.
   - **Model-Based RL**:
     - Examples: Planning and Simulation.

6. **Q-Learning and Value Function**:
   - Introduction to the **Bellman Equation**.
   - How Q-Learning helps in learning optimal policies.
   - The concept of **reward maximization**.

7. **Policy-Based vs. Value-Based Methods**:
   - **Value-Based**: Learn the best action values (e.g., Q-Learning).
   - **Policy-Based**: Directly learn the best policy (e.g., Policy Gradient).

8. **Introduction to Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**:
   - How Deep Learning enhances RL.
   - Using neural networks to approximate Q-values.

9. **Practical Libraries for RL**:
   - **Gym**: Simulated RL environments.
   - **Stable-Baselines3**: Prebuilt RL algorithms.
   - **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For Deep RL.
