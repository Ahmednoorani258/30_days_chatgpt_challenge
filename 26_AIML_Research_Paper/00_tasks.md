## 🗂️ Step-by-Step Tasks

### 1️⃣ Choose a Paper (April 2025 Relevant & Beginner-Friendly)
Here are some current, impactful paper topics (pick one!):

| **Title**                                | **Source**          | **Notes**                                      |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Gemma: Open-Weight Language Models**   | Google DeepMind, arXiv.org | Lightweight, open LLM alternative to GPT      |
| **Mixtral of Experts**                   | Mistral AI, arXiv   | Powerful MoE-based transformer model          |
| **LLaMA 3 Technical Report**             | Meta, arXiv         | Expected by April 2025                        |
| **ReAct Prompting in Agents**            | Various GitHub + arXiv | Combines reasoning and acting in LLMs         |
| **"Language Models as Tools"**           | arXiv               | Shows how LLMs can use APIs/tools autonomously|

🔍 **Tip**: Choose one that aligns with your interests (LLMs, Agents, NLP, RL, Vision, etc).

---

### 2️⃣ Skim First, Then Dive Deep
Use the **"skim → read → reflect"** method:
1. **Abstract & Introduction** → What’s the problem & motivation?
2. **Model/Method** → What's the new idea? Any diagrams?
3. **Experiments** → What did they test? What benchmarks?
4. **Conclusion** → Why does this matter? Any limitations?

---

### 3️⃣ Summarize in Your Own Words
Answer these in your journal or GitHub repo:
- **What problem does this paper solve?**
- **What makes their approach new or better?**
- **How can this model/tool be applied practically?**
- **Are there any limitations or open questions?**

---

### 4️⃣ Optional: Re-implement a Simple Part
If the paper has open code (many do), try:
- **Loading the pre-trained model**.
- **Running a demo** (text generation, image generation, etc.).
- **Modifying prompts or hyperparameters**.

🔧 **Papers with GitHub code**:
- **Gemma** on HuggingFace.
- **Mixtral** on HuggingFace.
- **ReAct Prompting** GitHub.
