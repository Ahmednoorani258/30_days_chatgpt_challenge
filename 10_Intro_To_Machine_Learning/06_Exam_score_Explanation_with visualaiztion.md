# üìä Student Exam Score Prediction with Visualization

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a simple machine learning model to predict exam scores based on study hours. The process includes data preparation, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## üõ† Step 2: Data Collection and Preparation

### What Happens:
- Synthetic data is created for study hours and exam scores.
- The data is organized into a table for further processing.

### Visualization:
1. **Creating Data**:
   - Generate 20 random study hours between 1 and 10 (e.g., 5.2, 7.8, 3.1).
   - Calculate exam scores using a rule: `score = 9 * hours + random noise`.
     Example:
     - For 5 hours, the score might be around 45, but with noise, it could be 47.3.

2. **Table Form**:
Study_Hours	Exam_Score
5.2	47.3
7.8	69.1
3.1	28.9
...	...


3. **Checking Data**:
- Check for missing values:
  ```
  Missing Values:
  Study_Hours    0
  Exam_Score     0
  ```
- No gaps, so the data is clean!

4. **Sneak Peek**:
- Preview the first few rows:
  ```
  Data Preview:
     Study_Hours  Exam_Score
  0       5.2        47.3
  1       7.8        69.1
  2       3.1        28.9
  ```

## ü§ñ Step 3: Model Selection

### What Happens:
- A simple method called **Linear Regression** is chosen to predict scores.
- The data is split into input (`X`) and output (`y`).

### Visualization:
1. **Input (X)**:
- A list of study hours shaped like `[[5.2], [7.8], [3.1], ...]`.
2. **Output (y)**:
- A list of exam scores like `[47.3, 69.1, 28.9, ...]`.
3. **Model**:
- A tool called `LinearRegression()` is used to learn how study hours connect to scores.

## üèãÔ∏è Step 4: Model Training

### What Happens:
- The data is divided into training and testing sets.
- The model is trained on the training set.

### Visualization:
1. **Splitting Data**:
- **Training Set**: 80% of the data (16 rows) for learning.
- **Testing Set**: 20% (4 rows) for evaluation.
- Picture two smaller tables: one big (training), one small (testing).

2. **Training**:
- The model finds a straight line that fits the training data best.
- It learns something like: `score = 9 * hours - 0.5`.

3. **Model Parameters**:
Slope (coefficient): 9.00 Intercept: -0.50

- **Slope (9)**: Each extra study hour adds about 9 points to the score.
- **Intercept (-0.5)**: The score if you study 0 hours (a small negative base).

## üìä Step 5: Model Evaluation

### What Happens:
- The trained model is used to predict scores on the test data.
- Accuracy is measured using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.

### Visualization:
1. **Predictions**:
- For a test hour like 6, the model predicts:
  ```
  9 * 6 - 0.5 = 53.5
  ```

2. **Comparing**:
Test Actual Scores: [50, 70, 30, 40] Predicted Scores: [53.5, 71.2, 28.0, 42.3] Differences: |50-53.5|=3.5, |70-71.2|=1.2, etc.


3. **MAE**:
- Average of the differences:
  ```
  Mean Absolute Error: 4.20
  ```
- On average, predictions are off by 4.2 points‚Äînot bad!

## üìà Step 6: Visualize the Results

### What Happens:
- A plot is created to compare the model‚Äôs predictions with actual scores.

### Visualization:
1. **Scatter Plot**:
- Blue dots represent actual test points (e.g., `(6, 50)`, `(8, 70)`), showing study hours (x-axis) vs. actual scores (y-axis).

2. **Line Plot**:
- A red line represents the model‚Äôs rule: `score = 9 * hours - 0.5`.

3. **What You See**:
- If the red line is close to most blue dots, the model fits well.
- Dots far from the line indicate less accurate predictions.

2. **Table**:
- Shows the data preview.
3. **Numbers**:
- Slope (9), Intercept (-0.5), MAE (4.2).
4. **Plot**:
- Blue dots (actual scores) and a red line (predicted scores).
