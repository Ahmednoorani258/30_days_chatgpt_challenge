# üìö Types of Machine Learning

Machine Learning is broadly categorized into three types, each with distinct approaches and applications.

---

## A. Supervised Learning (Basics)

### üß† Definition:
- Algorithms learn from **labeled data**, where each input (e.g., house size) is paired with a known output (e.g., price).
- The goal is to map inputs to outputs accurately.

### üîÑ How It Works:
1. **Training**:
   - Feed the model input-output pairs (e.g., "size: 1500 sq ft, price: $225,000").
2. **Prediction**:
   - After training, the model predicts outputs for new, unseen inputs.

### üìä Common Algorithms:
- **Linear Regression**:
  - Predicts continuous values (e.g., house prices) using a straight-line equation (`y = mx + b`).
- **Decision Trees**:
  - Splits data into branches based on feature values (e.g., "if size > 2000 sq ft, then...").
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**:
  - Finds a boundary (hyperplane) to separate classes (e.g., spam vs. not spam).

### üí° Example Use Cases:
- **Regression**:
  - Predicting house prices, stock values.
- **Classification**:
  - Email spam detection, disease diagnosis (e.g., cancer or not).

### üîç In-Depth Insight:
- **Loss Function**:
  - Measures prediction error (e.g., Mean Squared Error for regression). The model minimizes this during training.
- **Overfitting**:
  - A risk where the model learns the training data too well, including noise, and fails on new data.

## B. Unsupervised Learning (Basics)

### üß† Definition:
- Algorithms work with **unlabeled data**, finding hidden patterns or structures without predefined outputs.

### üîÑ How It Works:
1. **Clustering**:
   - Groups similar data points (e.g., customer segments).
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Simplifies data while retaining key information.

### üìä Common Algorithms:
- **K-Means Clustering**:
  - Groups data into K clusters based on similarity (e.g., grouping customers by purchase behavior).
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:
  - Reduces data dimensions for visualization or efficiency.
- **DBSCAN**:
  - Clusters data based on density, good for irregular shapes.

### üí° Example Use Cases:
- **Customer Segmentation**:
  - Identifying market groups without prior labels.
- **Market Basket Analysis**:
  - Finding items often bought together (e.g., bread and butter).

### üîç In-Depth Insight:
- **No Ground Truth**:
  - Unlike supervised learning, there‚Äôs no "correct" answer to check against, making evaluation trickier (e.g., silhouette score for clustering).
- **Exploratory**:
  - Great for discovering insights in raw, unstructured data.

## C. Reinforcement Learning (Advanced)

### üß† Definition:
- Algorithms learn by interacting with an **environment**, making decisions, and optimizing based on rewards or penalties.

### üîÑ How It Works:
1. **Agent**:
   - The learner (e.g., a robot).
2. **Environment**:
   - The world it operates in (e.g., a maze).
3. **Actions**:
   - Choices it makes (e.g., move left).
4. **Rewards**:
   - Feedback (e.g., +10 for reaching the goal, -1 for hitting a wall).

### üìä Common Algorithms:
- **Q-Learning**:
  - Uses a table to track action rewards, learning optimal policies.
- **Deep Q Networks (DQN)**:
  - Combines Q-Learning with neural networks for complex tasks.

### üí° Example Use Cases:
- **Game AI**:
  - AlphaGo learned to beat humans at Go by playing itself.
- **Robotics**:
  - A robot learns to pick objects through trial and error.

### üîç In-Depth Insight:
- **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**:
  - The mathematical framework behind RL, modeling states, actions, and rewards.
- **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
  - Balancing trying new actions (exploration) vs. using known good ones (exploitation).
