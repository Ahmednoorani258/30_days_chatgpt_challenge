### 2️⃣ Set Up Your Local Environment
1. **Fork the Repository**:
   - Fork the project to your GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Fork Locally**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
   cd project-name
   ```
Create a new branch for your work:

git checkout -b fix-typo-or-feature
Install dependencies (check README.md or requirements.txt):

pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Choose and Understand an Issue
Filter issues by labels: good first issue, documentation, bug, enhancement.

Read the issue description and any linked discussion.

Comment to express interest and ask clarifying questions if needed.

4️⃣ Make Your Changes
Code Contributions:

Fix bugs, add tests, improve performance, implement small features.

Documentation Contributions:

Improve README, write tutorials, fix typos.

Testing:

Ensure existing tests pass: pytest or project’s test command.

Write new tests for your changes if applicable.

5️⃣ Commit and Push
Stage your changes:

git add path/to/changed_file.py
Commit with a clear message:

git commit -m "Fix: corrected typo in README"  
Push to your fork:

git push origin fix-typo-or-feature
