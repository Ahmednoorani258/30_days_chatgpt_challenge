## 🛠 Tasks & Exercises

### 1️⃣ Pick a Platform & Solve at Least 5 Problems
Choose one of the following coding challenge platforms:

- **LeetCode** (Easy Level)
- **CodeWars** (Kyu 8–6)
- **HackerRank** (Easy Challenges)

Solve at least 5 problems on these topics:
- 🔹 **Strings & Lists:** Reverse a string, find duplicates in a list.
- 🔹 **Loops & Conditionals:** FizzBuzz, Prime number check.
- 🔹 **Functions & Recursion:** Factorial, Fibonacci sequence.

---

### 2️⃣ Follow a Structured Problem-Solving Approach
When solving problems, follow this 5-step approach:

1. **Understand the problem:** Read carefully and identify input/output.
2. **Plan your approach:** Think about possible solutions before coding.
3. **Write clean code:** Use meaningful variable names and comments.
4. **Test with different cases:** Handle edge cases like empty input or large values.
5. **Optimize if needed:** Check time and space complexity (Big O notation).

---

### 3️⃣ Debug & Optimize
- 🔹 Run your code with different test cases.
- 🔹 Use `print()` statements or a debugger to find issues.
- 🔹 If your solution is slow, research a better algorithm.
