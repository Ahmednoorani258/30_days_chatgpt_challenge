## üìö Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Day 1: Python Fundamentals**
- **File:** [readme.md](01_day_python_fundamentals/readme.md)
- **Objective:** Learn the basics of Python, including syntax, data types, and control structures.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Day 2: Advanced Python Topics**
- **Files:**
  - [01_decorators.py](02_day_Advance_python_topics/01_decorators.py): Learn about decorators and how they modify function behavior.
  - [02_context_manager.py](02_day_Advance_python_topics/02_context_manager.py): Understand context managers for resource management.
  - [03_Generators.py](02_day_Advance_python_topics/03_Generators.py): Explore generators for memory-efficient iteration.
  - [04_Iterators.py](02_day_Advance_python_topics/04_Iterators.py): Dive into iterators and the iterator protocol.
  - [checklist.md](02_day_Advance_python_topics/checklist.md): Track your progress with a detailed checklist.
  - [file.txt](02_day_Advance_python_topics/file.txt): Sample file for context manager and file handling exercises.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Day 3: Practice Coding Challenges**
- **File:** [Tasks.md](03_day_practice_coding_challenge/Tasks.md)
- **Objective:** Solve beginner-to-intermediate coding problems to improve logic, loops, and functions. Follow a structured problem-solving approach and practice debugging and optimization.
