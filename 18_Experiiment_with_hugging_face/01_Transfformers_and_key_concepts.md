# üß† Transformers and Key Concepts

Transformers are a class of deep learning models introduced in the 2017 paper **"Attention is All You Need"** by Vaswani et al. Unlike older models like RNNs or LSTMs, which process text sequentially (word-by-word), transformers process entire sentences simultaneously. This parallel processing makes them faster and more efficient, especially for long texts.

## üîë Why Are Transformers Revolutionary?

1. **Parallelization**:
   - They handle all words at once, leveraging GPUs effectively.
2. **Self-Attention**:
   - They capture relationships between words, no matter how far apart they are in a sentence.
3. **Scalability**:
   - They can scale to massive datasets and complex tasks, powering models like **BERT** and **GPT**.

## üß© Key Concepts Explained

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Tokenizers
- **Definition**: Tokenizers convert raw text into a format (tokens) that models can process‚Äîtypically numbers.
- **How It Works**:
  - Text is split into smaller units (words, subwords, or characters), and each unit is mapped to a unique ID in a vocabulary.
- **Example**:
  - For the sentence `"I love transformers"`, a tokenizer might split it into:
    - `["I", "love", "transform", "##ers"]` (subword tokenization, common in BERT).
    - These are then converted to IDs like `[101, 1045, 2293, 19081, 2015]`.
- **Why It Matters**:
  - Different models use different tokenizers (e.g., WordPiece for BERT, Byte-Pair Encoding for GPT), so matching the tokenizer to the model is crucial.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Architecture
- **Overview**:
  - Transformers consist of two main components:
    1. **Encoders**: Process input text to understand its meaning (used in BERT).
    2. **Decoders**: Generate output text based on the processed input (used in GPT).
  - Each encoder/decoder has multiple layers (e.g., 12 in BERT-base), each containing **self-attention** and **feed-forward neural networks**.
- **Example**:
  - In **BERT**, the encoder takes a sentence and outputs a rich representation of each token, capturing context from both directions (bidirectional).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Self-Attention
- **Definition**: A mechanism that lets the model weigh the importance of each word in a sentence relative to others.
- **How It Works**:
  - For each word, self-attention computes a score indicating how much it should "attend" to every other word. This captures dependencies, like subjects and verbs.
- **Simple Example**:
  - In `"The cat sat on the mat"`, the word `"cat"` pays high attention to `"sat"` (action) and `"mat"` (object), less to `"the"` or `"on"`.
- **Math Behind It**:
  - Each word is represented as a vector.
  - Three vectors are computed: **Query (Q)**, **Key (K)**, and **Value (V)**.
  - Attention scores = `softmax(Q * K^T / sqrt(d_k)) * V`, where `d_k` is the vector dimension.
- **Why It‚Äôs Powerful**:
  - Unlike RNNs, self-attention handles long-range dependencies (e.g., linking `"it"` to a noun paragraphs earlier).

## üåü Popular Transformer Models

| **Model**             | **Description**                                              | **Use Case**                          |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **BERT**              | Bidirectional, great for understanding text                  | Classification, Q&A                   |
| **GPT**               | Unidirectional, excels at generating text                    | Chatbots, text generation             |
| **T5**                | Treats all tasks as text-to-text, versatile                  | Summarization, translation, Q&A       |
| **DistilBERT**        | A distilled (smaller, faster) version of BERT                | Resource-limited settings             |

### Example:
For the sentence `"The bank by the river is flooded"`:
- **BERT**: Understands "bank" as the riverbank (due to context).
- **GPT**: Might generate a story about a flooded bank.
- **T5**: Could summarize it as `"Riverbank flooded."`
