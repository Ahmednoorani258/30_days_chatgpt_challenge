# 🔥 Project Title: Data Structure Playground

## 🎯 Project Objective
Build an interactive web app using **Streamlit** where users can explore and experiment with core data structures like **Lists**, **Stacks**, **Queues**, **Sets**, and **Dictionaries**. The goal is to help beginners and enthusiasts understand how data structures behave, perform basic operations on them (like insert, delete, search), and visualize changes in real-time.

## 🧱 Core Features

### ✅ 1. Select a Data Structure
- Dropdown menu to choose from:
  - **List**
  - **Stack**
  - **Queue**
  - **Dictionary**
  - **Set**

### ✅ 2. Visual Playground
Once a data structure is selected, users can:

## 🧑‍💻 Sample UI Layout in Streamlit

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("🧪 Data Structure Playground")

data_structures = ["List", "Stack", "Queue", "Set", "Dictionary"]
selected_ds = st.selectbox("Choose Data Structure", data_structures)

if selected_ds == "Stack":
    st.subheader("Stack Operations")
    value = st.text_input("Enter a value:")
    if st.button("Push"):
        # push to stack
        pass
    if st.button("Pop"):
        # pop from stack
        pass
    # Display stack visually
    
## 🧠 Bonus Challenges (Optional)
```
Take your project to the next level by implementing these advanced features:
1. **Dark Mode Toggle**:
   - Add a toggle button to switch between light and dark themes for better user experience.
2. **Animate Element Transitions**:
   - Use animations to visually represent changes in the data structure (e.g., adding or removing elements).
3. **Undo/Redo Functionality**:
   - Allow users to undo or redo their last operations for better interactivity.
4. **Save/Load Playground State**:
   - Enable users to save the current state of the playground to a file and reload it later using `SessionState`.
