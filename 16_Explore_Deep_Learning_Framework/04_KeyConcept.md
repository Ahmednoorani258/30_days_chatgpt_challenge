## ✅ 6. Key Concepts: Tensors, Autograd, and Model Training Loop

### 🔢 Tensors

**Definition:**  
Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays, similar to NumPy arrays, used for storing data like input features, weights, and outputs in deep learning.

| Feature     | PyTorch                   | TensorFlow                  |
|-------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Creation    | `torch.tensor([...])`     | `tf.constant([...])`       |
| GPU Support | `tensor.cuda()`           | `with tf.device('/GPU:0')` |

**Example (PyTorch):**
```python
import torch

tensor_cpu = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0])
tensor_gpu = tensor_cpu.cuda()  # Move to GPU

Example (TensorFlow):

python

import tensorflow as tf

with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
    tensor_gpu = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0])
🔄 Autograd (Automatic Differentiation)
```

Definition:
Autograd automatically tracks all operations on tensors to compute gradients, which are essential for training via backpropagation.

🔸 PyTorch (Dynamic Computational Graphs)
Tracks operations dynamically as they happen.

Great for debugging and custom model development.

Example:

```python

import torch

x = torch.tensor(2.0, requires_grad=True)
y = x**2 + 3*x + 1
y.backward()  # Compute gradients

print(x.grad)  # Gradient of y w.r.t x

```
Output:

tensor(7.)  # Since dy/dx = 2x + 3 => 2*2 + 3 = 7

🔁 Model Training Loop
Feature	PyTorch	TensorFlow
Approach	Manual loop (flexible & transparent)	.fit() method (quick & high-level)
Custom Loop	Yes, with full control	Yes, using tf.GradientTape
🔸 PyTorch Example:
``` python

for epoch in range(10):
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = loss_fn(outputs, targets)

    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()  # Autograd kicks in here
    optimizer.step()
🔸 TensorFlow Example (Custom Loop):

for epoch in range(10):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(inputs)
        loss = loss_fn(targets, predictions)

    grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))

```

## 🔚 Conclusion

Both frameworks are powerful and capable. The choice depends on:
1. **Your Goals**: Research vs deployment.
2. **Your Workflow**: Manual vs automated.
3. **Your Preference**: Pythonic control vs abstract layers.

💡 **Pro Tip**: Many developers start with **PyTorch** for learning and research, then move to **TensorFlow** when building production systems.
