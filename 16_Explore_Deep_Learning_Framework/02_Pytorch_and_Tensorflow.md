# ✅ Difference Between PyTorch and TensorFlow

## What Are Deep Learning Frameworks?
Deep learning frameworks are libraries that simplify building, training, and deploying neural networks—the core of modern AI. They handle complex mathematical operations (like matrix multiplications) and optimize computations, often leveraging GPUs for speed.

## PyTorch vs TensorFlow: The Basics

### **PyTorch**
- **Developed by**: Facebook’s AI Research Lab.
- **Key Feature**: Uses a **dynamic computational graph**. This means the graph (a map of your computations) is built as you run your code, making it flexible and easy to tweak.
- **Style**: Feels like writing regular Python—intuitive and beginner-friendly.
- **Popularity**: Loved by researchers for its flexibility and ease of debugging.

### **TensorFlow**
- **Developed by**: Google Brain.
- **Key Feature**: Originally used a **static computational graph** (built before running), but since version 2.0, it supports **eager execution** (like PyTorch’s dynamic approach).
- **Style**: More structured, with high-level tools like **Keras** for quick model-building.
- **Popularity**: A favorite in industry for production-ready systems and deployment.

## Example Analogy

- **PyTorch**: Like cooking a meal from scratch—you control every step and can taste-test as you go.
- **TensorFlow**: Like using a meal kit—it’s pre-packaged and streamlined, but you can still customize it.

## Takeaway
- **PyTorch**: Great for experimenting and learning, offering flexibility and ease of debugging.
- **TensorFlow**: Ideal for polished, scalable projects, with tools designed for production-ready systems.
