## ðŸ”§ Step-by-Step Tasks

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Install the Frameworks
Install PyTorch and TensorFlow using the following commands:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install tensorflow
```
## ðŸ’¡ If Using GPU
- Check PyTorch and TensorFlow's official sites for GPU setup instructions to leverage faster training.

## ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Understand Tensors

### What is a Tensor?
- A **Tensor** is a multi-dimensional array, the fundamental building block of deep learning frameworks.

### Tasks:
1. Create tensors in both **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**.
2. Perform operations like addition, multiplication, and reshaping.
3. Compare how tensors are handled in PyTorch vs TensorFlow.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Build a Basic Neural Network in PyTorch

### Goal:
- Build a model to classify digits (e.g., MNIST-like dataset).

### Tasks:
1. Define the architecture using `nn.Module`.
2. Implement a training loop with an optimizer and loss function.
3. Log metrics like **loss** and **accuracy** during training.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Build a Similar Model in TensorFlow/Keras

### Goal:
- Build the same model using TensorFlow/Keras.

### Tasks:
1. Use the **Sequential** or **Functional API** to define the model.
2. Train the model using the `.fit()` method.
3. Compare the syntax and simplicity with PyTorch.

## ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Analyze the Differences

### Comparison Table:

| **Feature**       | **PyTorch**                  | **TensorFlow**              |
|--------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Coding Style**   | Pythonic, Flexible          | More structured, High-level |
| **Debugging**      | Easier (Dynamic Graphs)     | More abstract               |
| **Community**      | Strong in Research          | Strong in Industry          |
| **Popular API**    | `torch.nn`, `autograd`      | `tf.keras`, `GradientTape`  |
