# üìö What is Keras?

Keras is a high-level API (Application Programming Interface) integrated into TensorFlow since version 2.0. It simplifies the process of building and training neural networks, making it accessible to beginners and efficient for experts. While TensorFlow handles the heavy lifting, Keras provides an intuitive interface to design, train, and deploy models.

## ü§î Why Use Keras?

1. **User-Friendly**:
   - Create a neural network in just a few lines of code‚Äîno advanced degree required!
   - Example:
     ```python
     from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
     from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

     model = Sequential([
         Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
         Dense(10, activation='softmax')
     ])
     ```

2. **Modular Design**:
   - Like playing with LEGO blocks‚Äîadd layers, tweak settings, and build whatever you want.

3. **Fast Experimentation**:
   - Perfect for quickly testing ideas, whether you‚Äôre a student or a researcher.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Keras Works (Simplified)

Keras lets you define a model by stacking layers‚Äîlike building a sandwich:
1. **Input Layer**: The bread that receives raw data.
2. **Hidden Layers**: The fillings that process the data.
3. **Output Layer**: The top layer that produces the final result.

Once the model is defined, Keras uses TensorFlow to:
- **Train the Model**: Adjust weights and biases to minimize errors.
- **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to predict outcomes on new data.

## üîç Advanced Insights

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **High-Level API**
- Keras hides the low-level details of TensorFlow, allowing you to focus on designing your model rather than managing memory or optimizing gradients.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Types**
Keras offers three ways to build models:
1. **Sequential API**:
   - For straightforward, layer-by-layer models.
   - Example: A basic digit classifier.
2. **Functional API**:
   - For complex models with multiple inputs/outputs or shared layers.
   - Example: A model that processes both text and images together.
3. **Model Subclassing**:
   - For total control, allowing you to code custom logic.
   - Example: A unique neural network architecture.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Integration with TensorFlow**
- Since Keras is part of TensorFlow, you get the simplicity of Keras combined with the raw power of TensorFlow in one package.

## ü•£ Analogy: TensorFlow and Keras

- **TensorFlow**: A full kitchen with every tool imaginable.
- **Keras**: A cookbook with clear, step-by-step recipes.
- You don‚Äôt need to know how the oven works to bake a cake‚Äîjust follow the instructions!
