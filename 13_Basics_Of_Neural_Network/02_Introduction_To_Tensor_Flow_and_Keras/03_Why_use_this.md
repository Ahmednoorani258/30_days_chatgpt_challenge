3. Why Use TensorFlow and Keras Together?
Basic Reasons
Ease of Use: Keras makes starting out a breeze, even if you’re new to programming or machine learning.
Power: TensorFlow provides the muscle to handle big datasets and complex models.
Support: Both tools are widely used, so there’s a huge community with tutorials, code examples, and pre-trained models to help you.
Advanced Reasons
Scalability: TensorFlow can scale from your laptop to a data center, running on CPUs, GPUs, or TPUs for lightning-fast training.
Deployment: Tools like TensorFlow Lite (for mobile devices) and TensorFlow Serving (for production servers) let you take your model anywhere.
Customization: Use Keras for quick setups, then dip into TensorFlow’s low-level APIs for fine-tuning or custom operations.
Real-World Example
Suppose you’re building an app to identify dog breeds from photos. With Keras, you can quickly design a neural network to recognize patterns in images. Then, TensorFlow trains it on thousands of dog pictures and deploys it to your phone with TensorFlow Lite. The combo makes it fast, easy, and practical.
