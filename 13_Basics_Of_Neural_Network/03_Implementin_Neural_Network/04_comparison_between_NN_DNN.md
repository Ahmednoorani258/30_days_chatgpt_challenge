# ðŸ“Š Comparison Between Neural Networks (NN) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN)

This table highlights the key differences between basic Neural Networks (NN) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN), focusing on their structure, complexity, applications, and more.

| **Feature**            | **Neural Network (Basic)**                                                                 | **Deep Neural Network (DNN)**                                                                                   |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**          | A model typically consisting of an input layer, an output layer, and possibly one hidden layer. | A neural network with multiple hidden layers, achieving greater "depth" for more complex learning.              |
| **Structure**           | - Input Layer<br>- One (or two) hidden layers<br>- Output Layer                            | - Input Layer<br>- Multiple hidden layers (2 or more)<br>- Output Layer                                         |
| **Number of Hidden Layers** | Usually 1 or 2 hidden layers.                                                           | 3 or more hidden layers (sometimes 10+ layers are used).                                                        |
| **Complexity**          | Low complexity, simple architecture that captures basic non-linear relationships.           | High complexity, capable of extracting detailed patterns and features through multiple abstraction levels.       |
| **Computational Cost**  | Requires less computation and memory; training is relatively fast.                          | Requires more computation, memory, and training time; often uses high-performance GPUs for training.            |
| **Feature Extraction**  | Extracts only basic features; limited representation capacity.                              | Performs hierarchical feature extraction: lower layers learn simple features (e.g., edges), higher layers learn complex concepts. |
| **Training Difficulty** | Easier to train with fewer parameters; gradient descent converges faster.                   | Training is more challenging due to issues like vanishing/exploding gradients; requires advanced techniques (e.g., batch normalization, dropout). |
| **Learning Capability** | Limited learning capability; defines basic decision boundaries.                             | Advanced learning capability; defines complex, non-linear decision boundaries.                                  |
| **Overfitting Issues**  | Lower risk of overfitting due to fewer parameters, but limited for complex data.            | Higher risk of overfitting due to a large number of parameters; requires regularization techniques.             |
| **Applications**        | Simple classification, regression, basic pattern recognition, and small-scale problems.     | Advanced tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and autonomous driving. |
| **Scalability**         | Limited scalability; better suited for small datasets and less complex problems.            | Highly scalable; designed for large datasets and complex problems.                                              |
| **Interpretability**    | Easier to interpret due to its simple architecture.                                         | Harder to interpret due to its "black box" nature; requires advanced methods for explanations and visualizations. |
